## üìª Project Description

Yet another 44-key handwired split keyboard. 

I liked the [Void Ergo S](https://github.com/victorlucachi/void_ergo), but I want to try a Corne style keyboard with a (semi-)dedicated arrow cluster, like the [Frame-48](https://github.com/gregsqueeb/Frame-48). I also added a vertical 2u key on each end where the numpad Enter key would be on a full-size keyboard, because of muscle memory, partially inspired by the [Skean's](https://github.com/krikun98/Skean) outer keys.
